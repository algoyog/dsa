# A Roadmap to DS & Algo Mastery
---

## Tier 1: The Medium Gauntlet (Core Competency)

These topics are frequently seen in technical interviews and are the bedrock of complex problem-solving. Mastering these will give you a significant edge.

### Data Structures

*   [ ] **Trie (Prefix Tree)**
    *   **What it is:** A tree-like data structure for efficient retrieval of keys in a dataset of strings.
    *   **Why implement it:** Essential for string-based problems, autocomplete features, and spell checkers. Implementing it forces you to work with nodes, pointers/references, and character sets.
*   [ ] **Disjoint Set Union (DSU) / Union-Find**
    *   **What it is:** A data structure that keeps track of a set of elements partitioned into a number of disjoint (non-overlapping) subsets.
    *   **Why implement it:** Incredibly fast for problems involving dynamic connectivity, like detecting cycles in an undirected graph or network-connectivity problems. Implementing the `union by rank/size` and `path compression` optimizations is a fantastic exercise.
*   [ ] **Segment Tree**
    *   **What it is:** A tree-based data structure for storing information about intervals or segments. It allows for fast querying of a range (e.g., find the sum, min, or max in `array[i...j]`) and updating values.
    *   **Why implement it:** A staple of competitive programming. It teaches you about tree construction based on arrays, recursion, and handling ranges. A Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree) is a related, often simpler, alternative for sum-based range queries.
*   [ ] **Balanced Binary Search Tree (AVL or Red-Black Tree)**
    *   **What it is:** A self-balancing BST. While Java's `TreeMap` is an implementation of a Red-Black Tree, building one yourself is a rite of passage.
    *   **Why implement it:** It provides a deep understanding of tree rotations and how to maintain balance to guarantee `O(log n)` performance for search, insert, and delete operations. An AVL tree is conceptually a bit simpler to start with.

### Algorithms

*   [ ] **Dynamic Programming (DP)**
    *   **What it is:** An optimization technique for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems.
    *   **Why implement it:** DP is a vast and critical domain. Start by implementing solutions to these classic problems, focusing on both top-down (memoization) and bottom-up (tabulation) approaches.
        *   [ ] Knapsack Problem (0/1, Unbounded, Fractional)
        *   [ ] Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
        *   [ ] Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) - with both O(n^2) and O(n log n) solutions.
        *   [ ] Edit Distance
*   [ ] **Advanced Graph Algorithms**
    *   **What they are:** Algorithms that solve common problems on weighted and directed graphs.
    *   **Why implement them:** Graphs model everything from computer networks to social connections.
        *   [ ] **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** Finds the shortest path in a graph with non-negative edge weights. Implement it using a Priority Queue for efficiency.
        *   [ ] **Bellman-Ford Algorithm:** Finds the shortest path in a graph that can have negative edge weights. Key for understanding how to detect negative cycles.
        *   [ ] **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm:** Finds all-pairs shortest paths in a weighted graph. A great example of a simple but powerful DP algorithm.
        *   [ ] **Prim's and Kruskal's Algorithms:** Both find a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) in an undirected, weighted graph. Implementing both exposes you to different algorithmic approaches (greedy with a priority queue vs. greedy with DSU).
*   [ ] **Backtracking**
    *   **What it is:** A general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions to computational problems, notably constraint satisfaction problems.
    *   **Why implement it:** It refines your understanding of recursion.
        *   [ ] N-Queens Problem
        *   [ ] Sudoku Solver
        *   [ ] Generate all Permutations/Combinations

## Tier 2: The Advanced Frontier (Becoming "Unbeatable")

These topics are often found in harder competitive programming challenges, advanced university courses, and specialized engineering roles. Mastery here signals a deep and versatile command of algorithms.

### Data Structures

*   [ ] **Suffix Tree / Suffix Automaton**
    *   **What they are:** Extremely powerful data structures for complex string problems. They can, for example, find all occurrences of a pattern string in `O(length of pattern)` time after initial processing.
    *   **Why implement them:** This is the pinnacle of string data structures. The Suffix Automaton is famously compact and powerful. Implementing one is a serious challenge but incredibly rewarding.
*   [ ] **Heavy-Light Decomposition**
    *   **What it is:** A technique to decompose a tree into paths, allowing you to run queries (like sum, max, etc.) on a path between any two nodes `u` and `v` efficiently, usually in `O(log^2 n)` or `O(log n)` time when combined with a Segment Tree.
    *   **Why implement it:** This is a key technique for advanced problems on trees.
*   [ ] **Skip List**
    *   **What it is:** A probabilistic data structure that provides an alternative to balanced trees. It uses linked lists at different "levels" to achieve `O(log n)` search time on average.
    *   **Why implement it:** It's a beautiful blend of simplicity and probability, and often much easier to implement correctly than a Red-Black Tree.

### Algorithms

*   [ ] **Max Flow Min Cut**
    *   **What it is:** A class of algorithms to find the maximum flow through a flow network. The max-flow min-cut theorem is a cornerstone of combinatorial optimization.
    *   **Why implement it:** It has applications in scheduling, network routing, and resource allocation. Start with the **Edmonds-Karp** algorithm (which uses BFS) and then move to the more advanced **Dinic's algorithm**.
*   [ ] **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)**
    *   **What it is:** An algorithm to compute the Discrete Fourier Transform and its inverse.
    *   **Why implement it:** Its most famous application in competitive programming is for multiplying large numbers or polynomials in `O(n log n)` time. It's a gateway to signal processing and advanced numerical algorithms.
*   [ ] **Advanced String Matching**
    *   **What they are:** Highly optimized algorithms for finding a pattern within a text.
    *   **Why implement them:**
        *   [ ] **Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP):** Uses a precomputed "prefix function" to avoid redundant comparisons, achieving `O(n+m)` time.
        *   [ ] **Rabin-Karp:** Uses hashing to find a pattern. A great example of randomized algorithms.
*   [ ] **Computational Geometry**
    *   **What they are:** Algorithms for solving problems about geometric objects.
    *   **Why implement them:** They require careful, precise coding.
        *   [ ] **Convex Hull:** (e.g., Graham Scan or Monotone Chain) Find the smallest convex polygon that encloses a set of 2D points.
        *   [ ] **Sweep Line Algorithm:** A general technique for solving geometric problems (e.g., finding intersecting line segments).

## Project Structure and Best Practices

### Suggested Project Structure

To stay organized, I suggest the following project structure. It separates your implementations from your tests, which is crucial.

### Key Advice

1.  **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Your JUnit setup is perfect for this. For every data structure or algorithm, write the tests *first*. Think about edge cases: empty inputs, single-element inputs, very large inputs, inputs with duplicates, etc. Your tests are your proof of correctness.
2.  **Use Generics:** Implement your data structures using Java generics (`class Trie<T>`, `class BST<T extends Comparable<T>>`) to make them reusable and type-safe.
3.  **Analyze Complexity:** For every single algorithm you write, add comments at the top analyzing its Time and Space Complexity. This is a non-negotiable part of mastery.
4.  **Practice on Platforms:** Implementing these is step one. Step two is learning to recognize when to use them. Solve problems on platforms like LeetCode (for interviews) and Codeforces/TopCoder (for competitive programming).
