# Arrays

## Overview

Arrays are one of the most fundamental data structures in computer science. They store elements in contiguous memory locations, allowing for constant-time access to individual elements using indices.

This section covers key array manipulation techniques and patterns that are frequently used in algorithmic problem-solving:

## Techniques Covered

1. [Two Pointers Technique](two-pointers.md)
2. [Sliding Window Technique](sliding-window.md)

## Common Array Operations

| Operation | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| Access    | O(1)           | O(1)             |
| Search    | O(n)           | O(1)             |
| Insert    | O(n)           | O(1)             |
| Delete    | O(n)           | O(1)             |

## Common Array Patterns

- In-place manipulation
- Prefix sums
- Kadane's algorithm for maximum subarray
- Dutch national flag algorithm
- Boyer-Moore voting algorithm

## When to Use Arrays

- When you need constant-time access to elements
- When the size of the data is known in advance
- When memory usage needs to be predictable
- When you need to iterate through elements sequentially

## When to Avoid Arrays

- When the size of the data is highly variable
- When frequent insertions and deletions are required
- When the data is sparse

## Java Implementation Notes

In Java, arrays have fixed size once initialized. For dynamic sizing, consider using `ArrayList` or other collection classes.
Arrays are one of the most fundamental data structures in computer science. They provide a way to store a collection of elements in a contiguous block of memory, allowing for constant-time access to individual elements using their indices.

## Key Characteristics

- Fixed size in many languages (Java arrays have fixed length once created)
- Elements stored in contiguous memory locations
- Constant-time access to elements via indices (O(1))
- Linear-time insertion/deletion in the middle (O(n))
- Base structure for many other data structures (dynamic arrays, strings, matrices)

## Common Techniques

This section covers techniques that leverage arrays' properties to solve problems efficiently:

1. [Sliding Window](sliding-window.md) - For problems involving subarrays/substrings
2. [Two Pointers](two-pointers.md) - For problems requiring coordinated traversal of arrays

## Applications

- Storage of homogeneous data elements
- Implementation of other data structures (stacks, queues, heaps)
- Matrix representation for graphs, images, and 2D spaces
- Storing results of operations for lookup tables (dynamic programming)
- String manipulation and pattern matching

## Complexity Analysis

| Operation | Time Complexity |
|-----------|----------------|
| Access    | O(1)           |
| Search    | O(n)           |
| Insertion | O(n)           |
| Deletion  | O(n)           |
| Traversal | O(n)           |

## Implementation Notes

When working with arrays, consider:

- Boundary conditions (empty arrays, single elements)
- Index management (off-by-one errors)
- Memory considerations for very large arrays
- Whether sorting the array first would simplify the solution
- If a dynamic array (ArrayList in Java) would be more appropriate

The following pages detail specific array techniques with examples, implementation details, and common problem patterns.
