# Tree Data Structures

## Overview

Tree data structures are hierarchical structures consisting of nodes connected by edges. Each tree has a root node, and every node except the root has a parent node. Trees are widely used to represent hierarchical relationships and enable efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations.

## Tree Types Covered

1. [Binary Trees](binary-tree.md) - Each node has at most two children
2. [Binary Search Trees (BST)](binary-search-tree.md) - Ordered binary trees for efficient search
3. [AVL Trees](avl-tree.md) - Self-balancing binary search trees
4. [Red-Black Trees](red-black-tree.md) - Balanced binary search trees with color properties
5. [B-Trees](b-tree.md) - Self-balancing tree data structures that maintain sorted data
6. [Tries (Prefix Trees)](../trie/README.md) - Trees used for efficient retrieval of keys in a dataset of strings

## Common Tree Operations

| Operation               | Binary Tree | BST (avg) | BST (worst) | AVL/Red-Black |
|-------------------------|------------|-----------|------------|---------------|
| Search                  | O(n)       | O(log n)  | O(n)       | O(log n)      |
| Insert                  | O(1)*      | O(log n)  | O(n)       | O(log n)      |
| Delete                  | O(n)       | O(log n)  | O(n)       | O(log n)      |
| Traversal (all nodes)   | O(n)       | O(n)      | O(n)       | O(n)          |
| Find Min/Max            | O(n)       | O(log n)  | O(n)       | O(log n)      |
| Predecessor/Successor   | O(n)       | O(log n)  | O(n)       | O(log n)      |

## Tree Traversal Methods

### Depth-First Traversals
1. **Inorder (Left, Root, Right)** - Visit left subtree, then root, then right subtree
2. **Preorder (Root, Left, Right)** - Visit root, then left subtree, then right subtree
3. **Postorder (Left, Right, Root)** - Visit left subtree, then right subtree, then root

### Breadth-First Traversal
- **Level Order** - Visit nodes level by level from top to bottom

## Common Tree Applications

- **Binary Search Trees**: Efficient searching, insertions, and deletions
- **Expression Trees**: Representing and evaluating arithmetic expressions
- **Decision Trees**: Machine learning algorithms for classification
- **Suffix Trees**: Pattern matching and string operations
- **Heap Trees**: Priority queues and scheduling
- **Segment Trees**: Range queries and updates
- **Trie Trees**: Dictionary implementations and autocomplete features

## When to Use Trees

- Need to represent hierarchical relationships
- Require efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations
- Need to maintain sorted data
- When balance between read and write operations is important
- Implementation of dictionaries, maps, and sets
- Network routing algorithms

## Java Implementation Notes

- Trees are typically implemented using node objects with pointers to children
- Recursive implementations are common but can lead to stack overflow for deep trees
- Iterative versions can be implemented using stacks or queues
- Self-balancing trees require additional mechanisms to maintain balance
- Serialization/deserialization is important for persistence

## Advanced Tree Concepts

- **Tree Balancing**: AVL rotations, Red-Black tree operations
- **Tree Serialization**: Converting trees to and from string or binary representations
- **Path Algorithms**: Finding paths between nodes, lowest common ancestor
- **Tree Compression**: Techniques to reduce memory usage
- **Concurrent Trees**: Thread-safe tree implementations
- **Spatial Trees**: Quad trees, k-d trees for multi-dimensional data
